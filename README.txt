# Stitched Image Analysis Scripts
# Made by Camilla J. Lindh, 2025

## Overview
This project contains two Python scripts for analyzing cell counts in images and visualizing the results. The first script, Stitched_Image_Analysis.py, processes image data to count cells in different channels and saves the results to CSV files. The second script, Plot_Data.py, generates line plots from the CSV data, showing the number of counted cells across frames.

## Scripts

### 1. Stitched_Image_Analysis.py
This script processes images from multiple channels, counts the number of cells in each frame using Fiji/ImageJ (via the ij module), and saves the results as CSV files for each channel.

### 2. Plot_Data.py
This script reads the CSV files generated by Stitched_Image_Analysis.py, creates line plots showing the number of counted cells against the frame number for each channel, and saves the plots as PNG images.

## Usage

Stitched_Image_Analysis.py: 

1. Make sure your image data is organized by channel.
2. Set the base_path and output_path configurations to match your directory structure.
3. Run the script. The results will be saved in CSV files named Channel_X_cell_counts.csv (where X is the channel number).

Plot_Data.py:

1. base_path: Path to the folder containing the CSV files.
2. output_path: Path where the plots will be saved.
3. channels: List of channel names (e.g., Channel_1, Channel_2, etc.).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- ImageJ with the ij module
- matplotlib
- Fiji (and Jython)
